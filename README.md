# Iris Flower Classification with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project involves building and evaluating a machine-learning model to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on their sepal and petal dimensions. We use the famous Iris Flower Dataset for this classification task.

## Steps
1. **Data Preparation**: Load the dataset, split it into features and target labels, and scale the features using standardization.
2. **Model Selection**: Choose logistic regression as the machine learning algorithm for classification.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train the logistic regression model, evaluate its performance using test data, and tune hyperparameters if necessary.
4. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

## File Description
- **Iris_Flower_Classification.ipynb**: This Kaggle notebook contains the code for the machine-learning model.
- **README.md**: This file provides information about the project, how to set it up, and how to use it.

## Usage
- Ensure you have installed Python and the necessary libraries (sci-kit-learn, pandas, numpy).
- Open the Kaggle notebook and follow the instructions to run the code.

## Conclusion
The logistic regression model performed well in classifying iris flowers into their respective species, achieving high accuracy and other favourable metrics. This project provides a solid foundation for understanding the machine learning workflow and can serve as a basis for more complex machine learning projects in the future.
